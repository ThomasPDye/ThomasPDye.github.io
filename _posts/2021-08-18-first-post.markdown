# Preface

I have been wondering whether I should make a Github Pages site (which, clearly, I have already begun).

I think, to make it clear in my own mind whether I should or not, I will list the pros and cons.

# Pros

- I have a public space to post thoughts and projects that exists outside of social media.
- It is harder to lose the data than if I kept things entirely private.

# Cons

- It is entirely public allowing unrestricted access to any ideas and projects I post.

# Conclusion

I like how this looks, now that I have begun, so I will continue to create this site.
